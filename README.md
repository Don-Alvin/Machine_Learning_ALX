# Machine_Learning_ALX
This is a series of machine learning projects. 

## 1. [Rands to Dollar exchange rate](https://github.com/Don-Alvin/Machine_Learning_ALX/blob/master/dollar.ipynb)
A Linear Regressions analysis to determine which factors on the dataset impact the exchange rate between the rand and dollar.

We start with a simple linear regression and use the **Value of Exports (ZAR)** to determine its relation to the target variable **ZAR/USD**.

We later use a **ridge** and **lasso** regression techniques for regularization.
