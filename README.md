[## Rands to Dollar exchange rate]()
A Linear Regressions analysis to determine which factors on the dataset impact the exchange rate between the rand and dollar.

We start with a simple linear regression and use the **Value of Exports (ZAR)** to determine its relation to the target variable **ZAR/USD**.

We later use a **ridge** and **lasso** regression techniques for regularization.
